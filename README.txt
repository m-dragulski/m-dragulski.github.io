I think that everything about my first Assignment has been implemented correctly. I made all three html pages, index.html, bio.html and resume.html. I did not use any stylistic elements in my html files. I made a css file for each html page. All html and css pages have been officially validated with not errors. 

I consulted about the assignment with Sophie Dasinger, a TA and Kenny Crowell, a student who took comp 20 several semesters ago.

I would say I worked about 6 or 7 hours total on this project.
